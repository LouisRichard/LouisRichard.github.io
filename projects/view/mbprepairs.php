          <h2>First one on apple machines</h2>
          <p>
          As the title suggests, this marks my first experience working on an Apple machine, apart from the occasional encounter with an iPhone 4 from years ago.<br/>
          Interestingly, this particular machine was handed to me by my dad, labeled as "not working." However, to my surprise, it functioned perfectly fineâ€”at least initially.<br/><br/>
          Soon, I encountered a peculiar issue: whenever pressure was applied near the I/O Board connector, the computer would instantly crash.<br/>
          This problem persisted even when the computer was placed on a flat surface.<br/>
          In an attempt to address this issue, I decided to take matters into my own hands. Armed with a drill and a file, I carved a hole in the bottom cover where the connector is located (see img-3).<br/><br/>
          Unfortunately, this makeshift fix proved to be short-lived, and the issue worsened over time. Eventually, even with the I/O board disconnected and the computer opened up, the problem persisted sporadically.<br/>
          My current hypothesis is that at least one of the memory modules is faulty, leading to kernel panics with slight movement.<br/><br/>
          In 2024, after loosing many auctions to get another laptop, I ordered a new logic board along with a few tools on AliExpress and took it upon myself to replace the faulty board.<br/>
          This ended up costing me more than one of these second hand but you can't really put a price on a new experience.
